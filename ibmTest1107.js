// item 1: pangrams -- Given an array of strings, return a string composed of 1s and 0s that indicates whether each string is a pangram. 1 for pangrams, 0 for not pangrams
// example const ["abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqxyz", "ab"] => "10";

// item 2: given an array reresenting teams and team size and a value k representing the number of teams that can be reduced, return the maximum number of teams that can be provided of the same size:
// example (teamSizes = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 5], k = 3) ==> result = 5
// because there are two ones, and up to three teams can be reduced down to 1 - a total of 5. There are three teams of size 5, but no teams can be reduced down to 5
